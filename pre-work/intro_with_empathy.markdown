### Turing Culture: Developing Empathetic Programmers

_Our **mission** is to unlock human potential by training a diverse, inclusive student body to succeed in high-fulfillment technical careers._

### Why Empathy?
* Interpersonal skills (including empathy) have a direct, significant impact on your professional success.
* Empathy is a foundational interpersonal skill. Other skills, such as collaboration, communication, compromise all hinge on your ability to demonstrate empathy.
* Interpersonal skills, including empathy, can be developed and improved.
* Turing's mission (cited above) demands that we support students development of technical _and_ interpersonal skills. 

### Pre-Work Preparation
#### Read
Read _two_ of the following articles/videos (we recommend all of them!) and reflect on these questions: why are we talking about empathy at a software development school? how can you develop the "skill" of empathy? and why should you care?

* ["Why is Empathy Important for Design"](http://www.bresslergroup.com/blog/why-empathic-design/)
* ["The Surprising (Nontechnical) Skill You Need to Succeed in Tech"](https://www.themuse.com/advice/the-surprising-and-nontechnical-skill-you-need-to-succeed-in-tech), _The Muse_
* ["Why Aren't We More Compassionate?"](http://www.ted.com/talks/daniel_goleman_on_compassion#t-39146), TED Talk (Daniel Goleman)
* ["Can you teach people to have empathy?"](http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-33287727), BBC (Jun 29, 2015)
* ["Three Kinds of Empathy"](http://www.danielgoleman.info/three-kinds-of-empathy-cognitive-emotional-compassionate/), Daniel Goleman
* ["The Importance of Empathy in Our Services-Centric, People-Oriented Economy"](http://blogs.wsj.com/cio/2015/10/09/the-importance-of-empathy-in-our-services-centric-people-oriented-economy/), _Wall Street Journal Blog_ (Oct 9, 2015)

#### Reflect
After reading the articles above, create a gist on Github and reflect (4-6 sentences) on the following prompts.
* What role does empathy play in your life and how has it helped you?
Empathy's role in my life is what has led me to become a better mother.  When I landed in the hospital for post-partum depression, I very quickly learned that my perfect-mom-syndrome was going to be the death of me.  It wasn't enough that my son had a mother that was barely surviving, but I also wouldn't be of any use to him dead.  I had to develop a middle ground, and in order to understand where that middle ground existed, I had to be kinder to myself.  One of the deepest major lessons I hold close to my heart, required a high level of empathy.  The first phrase is, "He (my son) doesn't need a perfect mom, he needs a consistant mom.  I am consistantly on time to work, I can create a consistant evening routine for him."  This line of logic helps me overcome all the ways "not being enough" sneaks up on me and makes me feel bad about myself.  

* How does empathy help you build better software?
Empathy helps build better software because if we are empathetic with ourselves, we can be more empathetic with our users and connect with them and meet them where they are at.  I like to think about an archiving project I was part of in college.  I could've built an archive that helped me track what I needed and wanted.  But at the end of the day, it wasn't just me who would be using the archive.  So establishing a simple "first round" of the archive allowed for it to mold and grow with the needs of the students and researchers being the central focus of any future changes to the archive.  When you're in deep relationship with your user and you can implement user-focused advancements, then you stop imagining a fictional user and you start giving yourself pathways to engage with your preconcieved bias.


* Why is empathy important for working on a team?
Because we are humans and not humanoids, we have feelings.  In a team, being able to relate effectively with others is required so that you can engage with integrity and camraderie.  Also, in order for the team members to engage in effective creativity and be willing to engage in risk-taking and experimentation, you need to be able to encourage the ritual of making mistakes in front of each other.  That means you can't take yourself too seriously and you have to be able to present patterned thinking that makes people hesitate or doubt their role in the team. 

* Describe a situation in which your ability to empathize with a colleague or teammate was helpful.
I keep thinking about this time there was a staff retreat.  There weren't a lot of moms on our team, so the ones that we moms, I took notice of them, their moods, their needs, their anxieties.  I would check in with them often just so that there was an open mode of communication between us.



* When do you find it most difficult to be empathetic in professional settings? How can you improve your skills when faced with these scenarios?
